# Satellite-Path-Tracking 

**A ReactJS based Starlink Trajectory Visulization App.**

## Overview

The project is created to help keep track of the path of satellites sent by N2YO.
Hence, we called the APIs from N2YO.

You should sign up to the N2YO and get the API key at first before you execute this project. 

Then you can download the code and put the API key inside the code. You can then run the code in Browser and see how it works.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

#### What we do: 

1. Designed and developed a visualization dashboard using ReactJS and D3 to track satellites in real-time based on geo-location.

2. Built location, altitude, and duration based selector to refine satellite search.

3. Animated selected satellite paths on a world map using D3 to improve the user friendness.

4. Deployed the dashboard to Amazon Web Service for demonstration.

## Start quickly for this project (Assme that you set up VS code)

#### 1. Install Node

Please refer to https://nodejs.org/en/ to install node.js. I use version 12.8.3 LTS.

#### 2. Get a key for API calls

Register on N2YO: https://www.n2yo.com/login/register then you can get your 
API key. 

#### 3. Install create-react-app

In your IDE terminal, use command 

`npm install -g create-react-app`

to help you create a react app environment and also build the source 
libraries easily. 

#### 4. Clone and run the app in local. 

Install all the npm packages by using the command line 
`npm install`

After that, we should type `npm start` to run this application. 

The application runs on localhost:3000

The url is shown below: http://localhost:3000/

NOTE: if your port 3000 is occupied (e.g., you are running other app using this 
port at the same time), then the local will change to another port like 3001, 3002 ....
